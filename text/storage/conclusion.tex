\section{Conclusion}
    Faced with growing demand for storage, image hosting services are increasingly turning to dynamic image resizing to improve the efficiency of image storage.
We showed that progressive encodings can dramatically reduce the amount of data that needs to be read for resizing images---potentially saving over 80\% of read bandwidth when tuned encode-time parameters used.
Finally, we give an estimate of progressive JPEG decode overheads which suggests that while serving custom progressive images directly to energy-constrained devices is difficult to justify, transcoding custom progressive JPEG on the server side incurs acceptable overheads.
